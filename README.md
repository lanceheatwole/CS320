How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my software is functional and secure by having complete test coverage and manually reviewing the code as well. Using JUnit testing, I can break down the code into different units and test each unit individually. This will help identify issues in different units and makes editing the code even easier.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I do this by listening and making notes about what the customer expects from their application and ensuring that the project covers 100% of their needs.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first getting all of the customer needs, creating a pseudocode that will be used as a skeleton of the eventual finished code and then designing the code based on that skeleton. Then testing afterwards will make sure that there are no errors. Changing or editing the code may happen at this point to prevent any issues.
